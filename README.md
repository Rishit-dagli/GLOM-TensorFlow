# GLOM TensorFlow

This Python package attempts to implement GLOM in TensorFlow, which allows advances made by several different groups 
transformers, neural fields, contrastive representation learning, distillation and capsules to be combined. This was 
suggested by Geoffrey Hinton in his paper 
["How to represent part-whole hierarchies in a neural network"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12627).
